# Shakespeare-Shiny
Created a shiny application that investigated word counts throughout Shakespeare Plays
You can access my app [here](https://h3qdb5-joseph-hines.shinyapps.io/hines_problem_set_3_practice/)
## How to re-create the application
1. Download the Shakespeare folder
2. Open the R Project
3. Run the application
